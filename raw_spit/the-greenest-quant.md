# The Greenest Quant

She's my master  
She goes down faster  
In my head Seeing numbers  
Can't get out of this slumber  
What is this fuckin life for?  
Who am I just waking up for?  
I had enough mate  
Just enough mate  
Tired of counting and re-counting  
Fear inducing  
And it's just the tip  
Yeah tip-toeing around  
Odorless and wandering  
Why am I going so far for?  
Golden cage in a not-so-golden age  
Feels like dope  
Is addictive as hell  
But behaves like it  
Good to be home  
It's comfortable as a quant  
As a motherfuckin quant  
When am I quittin?  
Probably never but asap  
Asap but it's a rocky situation  
I'm counting and counting  
It's raising and raising  
But I can't anymore man  
I can't anymore  
Why am I in again?  
The point of all this man?  
Oh yeah making shit tons  
Buying some bragging rights  
Making sure that I'm above and beyond  
Perched atop my ego tower  
Looking down on my dignity but wanking myself over it  
Drudgery is lurking from the corner  
Jaded in a one-dimensional jail  
Oh damn  
Oh damn is that really it?  
Born to not be alive  
Getting injections of green notes  
To survive but not exercising freedom  
Freedom to fuck around  
Freedom to just feel  
Freedom to add more colors  
I hate green
